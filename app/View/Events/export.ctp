<h2>Export</h2>
<p>Export functionality is designed to automatically generate signatures for intrusion detection systems. To enable signature generation for a given attribute, Signature field of this attribute must be set to Yes.
Note that not all attribute types are applicable for signature generation, currently we only support NIDS signature generation for IP, domains, host names, user agents etc., and hash list generation for MD5/SHA1 values of file artifacts. Support for more attribute types is planned.
