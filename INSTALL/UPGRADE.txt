	./Console/cake acl create aco root controllers
	./Console/cake AclExtras.AclExtras aco_sync

- Log in with the site admin credentials and execute the following commands by changing the url 
(where <MISP> is the address of your instance):
	- https://<MISP>/events/generateCorrelation
	- https://<MISP>/events/generateCount

	Organisation identifier used by the users of your organisation and by the sync users of 
	other hosting organisations that synchronise with your instance.
